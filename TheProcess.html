          <h4 style="text-align:center ;">Tattoo Gun</h4>
          <p> We use wireless tattoo machines to provide the best service possible.
            The chances of making a small error are almost negligible as there is no wire pull.
            We use, FK Irons Flux, Critical X Bishop Power Wands, Cheyenne Sol Nova Unlimited just
            to name a few. These machines also have a run time of almost 10 hours and hands can be
            used for an entire workday. </p>

          <h4 style="text-align:center ;">Nitrile Gloves</h4>
          <p> This may sound gross, but tattooing itself is the process of creating an open wound which becomes a
            tattoo.
            And hence cleanliness has to be at its peak and any bacteria, virusess etc. need to be removed. The first
            step
            other than having a clean workspace is the usage of gloves to maintain sanitation. While Latex Gloves, or a
            good and feasible option there are a lot of people with latex allergy and with in long-term use, can also
            cause
            allergy and other skin issues to the artist. To avoid this we use nitrile gloves, they give you the freedom
            to
            move and provide exact designs without compromising safety.</p>

          <h4 style="text-align:center ;">Inks</h4>
          <p> We do both black and white and color tattoos and so we make sure that we select the best ink for it to
            not fade for the longest time possible and so that our tattoos come out as vibrant as possible.
            We use brands like Eternal ink, World Famous ink, Silverback ink among many to make sure thw
            customer returns happy with the small piece of art on their body.</p>

          <h4 style="text-align:center ;">Numbing Cream</h4>
          <p> Pain is one of the biggest reasons why people are scared of getting tattoos, even if they really want one.
            Here at The Tattoo Co. we try our best to not let fear come in the way. We keep a number of
            creams handy for the same purpose Creams like Dr. Numb 5%, BCOT Pain Reducing Numbing Cream, TAONMEISU
